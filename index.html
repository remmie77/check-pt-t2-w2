<!-- Create a <button> element on the DOM, you may do this in jQuery,
     or write it directly in the HTML code. Have the button text read "Generate".

    Using jQuery, append a <div> element when you click the button.
    
    Inside the <div> element you created in the previous step, create a 
        <p> element that shows how many times you have clicked the button from the first step.
    
    Inside the <div> element you created in step two, append two <button> 
        elements. The text of the two buttons should read "Swap" and "Delete".
    
    In a CSS file, any <div> created using the "Generate" button should
         have a Red background-color.
    
    Clicking a "Swap" <button> should change its parent background-color from Red to Yellow.
    
    Clicking the "Swap" <button> again should turn the color back to Red.
    
    Clicking a "Delete" <button> should remove its parent <div> 
        container (and all of its contents).
    
    No need to do anything beyond the challenge described above. Once you are complete,
     check your code into a GitHub repo and submit via this application. -->
